# Final-Fail-Log-Continued-from-Week-5

Currently trying to using Regexr on an edition of the equity to see the matches with the term korean War

Struggling to figure out the code that will allow for this

After searching and barley finding any mentions of the Korean War in the editions of the equity that I searched through on RegExr I decided to do another topic

I will now compare the amount of times that Quebec is mentioned compared to how often Ontario is often

first i will put an edition onto the RegExr and put in a code to figure out how many times Quebec is mentioned
